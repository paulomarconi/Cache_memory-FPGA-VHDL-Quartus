# Simple Computer Architecture using direct mapped cache memory (aka FinalProjectFico)

Design, simulation and implementation of a direct-mapped cache memory system in VHDL using Altera Quartus Prime and DE0_CV FPGA development kit, and compare it to a reference system without cache memory to verify the performance enhancement.

- Open Guidelines__P2_W17.pdf       
- Review FinalProjectFico_docs/FinalProjectFico.mp4 and FinalProjectFico_docs/Project_Report.pdf
- Open SimpleCompArch.qar archive project, compile and simulate with ModelSim, set time simulation to 17 ns to see all resultant elements of matrix C.
- Project done in Quartus 16.1 and ModelSim 10.5b
- FinalProjectFico.mp4 uploaded to  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvd96RGTEjk
