# Simple computer architecture using direct-mapped cache memory system in VHDL using Quartus for DE0_CV FPGA (aka FinalProjectFico)

Design, simulation and implementation of a direct-mapped cache memory system in written VHDL using Altera Quartus Prime and DE0_CV FPGA development kit. The results are compared to a system without cache memory to verify the performance enhancement.

- Open `Guidelines__P2_W17.pdf`       
- Open `FinalProjectFico_docs/FinalProjectFico.mp4` and `FinalProjectFico_docs/Project_Report.pdf`
- Open `SimpleCompArch.qar` archive project, compile with `Quartus 16.1` and simulate with `ModelSim 10.5b`, set time simulation to 17ns to see all resultant elements of matrix multiplication C.
- Project done in `Quartus 16.1` and `ModelSim 10.5b`
- Video of operation `FinalProjectFico.mp4` uploaded to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvd96RGTEjk
